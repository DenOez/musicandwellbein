    <h1>You can help us find answers on this subject in 2 steps:<br>
        <br>
        Step 1: Allow Spotify to send us information about your music listening habits<br>
        <br>
        Step 2: Participate in a survey, which takes about 10 minutes<br>
        <br>
        All infomation that we receive from Spotify will be treated confidentially and completely anonymously.<br>
        By clicking on the link below you will be redirected to Spotify, where you can login with your Spotify account.<br>
        With your login you allow Spotify to send us information about your music listening habits. You can be sure,
        that no other information will be send to us.<br>
        <br>
        After that you will receive a personal code from us, which you need to enter just before beginning the survey.<br>
        Please, donâ€™t forget to note this code somewhere, otherwise we will not be able to identify which data<br>
        belong to which survey.<br>
